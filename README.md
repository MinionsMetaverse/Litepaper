Abstract: Minions Metaverse is a  multi-player interactive game that is played in a memefied virtual world that mimics real-life America.  

Players in Minions Metaverse are represented by an avatar in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), and cooperate and confront each other in groups and individually in constructing real-world missions and are rewarded for completing them.

Minion (MINI) token is the native currency and primary mode of the transaction within the virtual economy of the metaverse and is used for a variety of use cases such as buy and sell goods and services, space, bribe, lobbying and user rewards. 

Minions Metaverse is governed by DAO and MINI token holders can vote, make proposals and participate in the platform governance. 



1.	Introduction

Metaverse is a fully-realized digital world that exists beyond the one in which we live. It is a simulated virtual environment, which primarily involves two concepts: digital second life and augmented reality (AR)/ virtual reality (VR).  

The term "metaverse" has its origins in Greek words, "meta" and "universe." It was coined by author Neal Stephenson in his 1992 science-fiction novel “Snow Crash,” which envisions a virtual reality-based successor to the internet. In the novel, people use digital avatars of themselves to explore the online world, often as a way of escaping a dystopian reality. 

Some of the earliest metaverse projects, though they did not specifically identify in the term, are  Second Life, and most multiplayer games such as Fortnight, World of Warcraft, which create a virtual world where the players buy and sell land, build, and form groups and achieve goals.
With the recent popularity of metaverse, including Facebook’s rebranding into Meta, the metaverse market is expected to reach USD 800 billion by 2024, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. 


2.	Minions metaverse 

Minions Metaverse is a  multiplayer interactive and cooperative game, that is played in a memefied virtual world America. Minions Metaverse is a simulated virtual environment that recreates and mimics the real-world political fisticuff. 
It is a shared, immersive virtual world in which players interact with each other, construct experiences, and create real-world objects and landscapes. Minions Metaverse tracks the Trump presidency 2024 and the game evolves to mimic the real-life campaign as it evolves. 
The experience can be improved with augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) and linking with social media.



3.	Players
Minions metaverse is a user interactive simulated virtual environment, in which opposing and allied groups and individuals compete to achieve their desired ends. 

Each player is represented by an avatar in the form of a non-fungible token.

Minions metaverse include following groups

 Minions: Minions relish serving their despicable boss.
Their boss is a tax dogging misogynist racist bigot. Minions have no qualms about it. Indeed, that makes them adore him more.
The despicable boss set the tone and minions jolly well follow suit, compete to achieve these tasks and feel a sense of importance. 


Dems: Minions enemy number one,  Dems have some very nasty ideas like universal health care, voting rights and being a little nice to political refugees.

 Antifa: These Radical college kids are a pain in the ass

Blacks: Black Blue lives matter

Immigrants: They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists

Fox: Minions’ trusted source of news. Want a job? Try the luck, get spanked by Ailes 

FBI: Unlucky ones get caught

Jail: If you go there, don’t drop the soap!

 Suitcase Bride: Best of the Minions get rewarded with a Suitcase bride from Estonia 




4.Minions Metaverse economy

Minion (MINI token) is the native currency of the ecosystem.  The users can buy, sell, and trade digital real estate, items, avatar accessories, with the MINI token. 

User rewards
MINI token is also used to reward the users. When they successfully complete their master’s targets, minions get rewarded in Minion (MINI) tokens.  

18 % of the total supply of MINI tokens are allocated for ecosystem Rewards. Rewards will be distributed by the reward pool contract.

Deflationary
The minion token is deflationary. 1 % of MINI tokens auto burns during every DEX sale.

Token holder rewards. 2% of all sales are remitted in BUSD to all wallets holding MINI tokens.

MINI Token use cases

Players buy Add- Ons with MINI token.

Users Receive rewards in MINI token.

Provide Liquidity to MINI token and earn liquidity rewards

Buy Minion NFTs with MINI token


Governance

Minions are governed by Democratic Autonomous Organization (DAO) smart contracts.
MINI token holders can submit proposals, call elections ( subject to quorum), vote and participate in the platform governance. 

Problem: Trust issues
For start-up projects, the reliance on fiat currency as an entry to virtual economies could create regulatory problems. The use of non-blockchain platform tokens exposes trust issues. 

Solution 
Whereas the use of cryptocurrency, of which transactions are governed by smart contracts and published in the public ledger of blockchain create space for trustless transactions within the metaverse. 

Problem: Excessive gas fee 
Some of the recent metaverse projects in the crypto sphere, which use Ethereum blockchain entail prohibitively expensive gas fees, which in effect make them unsustainable for anything other than as a speculative investment. This in return increases entry cost for new entrants and stymies the potential growth and mass adoption of the platform. 

Solution
Minions metaverse is built on Binance Smart Chain and can be swapped between other ERC-20  compatible blockchains.  Smart chain is exceptionally low cost and faster than the Ethereum Mainnet at the moment.

2% remitted to all wallets in BUSD
1% Burn
